About
Aspiring Full-Stack Developer | React & C++ Enthusiast | 900+ DSA Problems Solved
I’m a final-year B.Tech CSE student at Harcourt Butler Technical University with strong software development expertise in C/C++, JavaScript and hands-on experience in React.js, Node.js, and full-stack development. I’ve built impactful projects like a Hospital Management System and a chess-based game (BattleBoard) using OOP and DSA principles.
Currently interning at Servosys Solutions, I’m contributing to a Form Builder web app using React and focusing on performance, reusability, and UI improvements.
I’m also skilled in MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, and tools like Git, GitHub, SVN, and VS Code. With 900+ problems solved on GeeksforGeeks and 400+ on LeetCode, I bring strong problem-solving skills, a collaborative mindset, and a passion for learning modern technologies. I’m actively seeking Full-Time Software Development roles to build scalable, user-centric solutions and grow as a developer.

🎓 A Beautiful Journey Comes to an End — and a New One Begins! 🚀
Feeling proud to share that I’ve completed my Engineering degree from Harcourt Butler Technical University, Kanpur.
The journey was full of learning, challenges, late-night discussions, coding sessions, and countless memories that shaped both my personality and thinking. My time at HBTU taught me not only technical concepts but also teamwork, patience, and how to approach real-world problems with logic and creativity.
I’m truly grateful to my family, professors, mentors, and friends who have been a constant source of support and motivation throughout these years. Your encouragement made this achievement possible. 🙏
As I step into the next phase of my career, I look forward to learning new technologies, solving impactful problems, and growing every single day. 🌱
